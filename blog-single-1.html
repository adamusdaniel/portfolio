              <h3 class="mb-4">Project Description</h3>
              <p>Moovit is one of the most accessible and popular apps for checking out public
                transport connections. As the UX Bats team, along with our partner Miquido, we
                were required to discover even more ideas on how to use existing solution to
                cover other users needs.</p>
                <strong><b>Problem</b></strong>
              <p>What digital tool can help blind people in their daily movement
                around the city?</p>
              <strong><b>Solution</b></strong>
              <p>Adding new functionalities to an already existing, accessible app
                (Moovit)</p>
             
<br><br>

                <h3 class="mb-4">Challenge</h3>
                <p>Through vision, we receive over 80% of the information about the world around us. How do
                  blind people deal with public spaces? What tools does the contemporary world provide
                  them with?
                  
                  Our team was assigned the difficult task of creating a digital product for people with visual
                  impairments that would help them navigate around town. We had no idea how much
                  knowledge we would need to acquire before we could even begin the design process!</p>

                <p><img src="content/niewidomi/percentage.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>
             
                <h3 class="mb-4">Research</h3>
                <p>On the market, there are plenty of apps that aim to improve the lives of individuals with
                  visual impairment. However, these apps often fall short due to the following reasons:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>Lack of a defined business model
              <li>Lack of consistency in municipal infrastructure: pavement solutions, tactile pavings,
                directional or guidance tactile, and wayfinding</li>
               <li>There are barely any legal regulations regarding standards, for example: pathways for
                the visually impaired</li>
             </ul>
             
             
                <p>The initial phase of work on the product involved conducting research with potential
                  users. The concept of helping the visually impaired get around the city was
                  completely new to us. However, after 25 hours of conversations, we had an almost
                  clear vision of our product (or so we believed at the time!).</p>
                  <p>We have identified several concrete facts from the conversations we conducted. Blind
                    people do not desire another application solely targeted at the visually impaired. They
                    want inclusive products that they can use on their phones. They do not want any
                    additional devices that would make it harder to navigate the city. Additionally, they
                    warmly welcome any facilities in the public space.</p>
                    <p>After completing this phase of research, we made the decision to narrow down the
                      target group to just blind people. People with visual impairments have completely
                      different problems.</p>

               
               
                <h3 class="mb-4">Problems</h3>       
               <p>We identified a group of issues related to blind people using public transportation and
                focused our subsequent work on addressing those problems.</p>
                 <p><img src="content/niewidomi/image_2.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>    

                      <h3 class="mb-4">Pivots</h3>
                      <p>User Journey Map, Value Proposition Canvas, and Eisenhower Matrix allowed us to
                        generate three ideas for products that could potentially address our users.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, two of them turned out to be too big to implement and they did not address
                          one of the major issues faced by the blind - the need to install an additional app on their
                          phone. After several iterations, we finally decided to redesign the Moovit app, a popular
                          tool utilized by visually impaired individuals for navigating the city during their travels.</p>

              <p><img src="content/niewidomi/image_3.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>

              <h3 class="mb-4">Design</h3>       
                            
                      <p>Based on the mapped-out flow and wireframes, we have created the final design of the
                          Moovit app. We have added push notifications, additional settings specifically designed for
                          visually impaired individuals, and a scanner for nearby vehicles.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, we enhanced
                          the entire process with onboarding. Thanks to it, users can discover the new functionalities
                          of the familiar app and learn that at every stop, there is a service design element waiting for
                          them - safe zone.</p>
              <p><img src="content/niewidomi/image_4.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>

              <h3 class="mb-4">Usability Testing</h3>       
                            
                      <p>Conducting reliable research was very difficult due to the lack of
                        prototype support for screen readers.</p>
                        <p>We created a prototype in Adobe XD - the app allows users to play
                          prerecorded audio. In order to conduct research, we recorded voice
                          notifications using a speech synthesiser and created a dashboard to
                          manage them. The blind person was using the standard Moovit app
                          during the tests and we played the notifications at specific moments.</p>
                      <p><img src="content/niewidomi/image_5.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>        
                      <p>The location for research was always a pavement or a bus stop. We
                        had a Bluetooth speaker that our respondents could hang around
                        their necks or hold close to their ears</p>
                        <p>We have even created elements of Service Design! Not only that, but
                          we crafted a prototype of Safe Zone using cardboard and bottle caps.
                          The prototype was designed to be tactile, allowing it to be sensed
                          using a white stick and feet. We constructed a bus out of a cardboard
                          box to simulate its arrival at the bus stop.</p>

                          <h3 class="mb-4">Summary</h3>       
                            
                          <p>Usability testing with a visually imparted view provides us even more insight of the product we have made.
                            All the tested users were extremely impressed, especially in fact of the lack of implementation. However, we
                            have identified opportunities to improve the application following the gathered feedback.</p>   

                            <ul>
                              <li>We decided not to implement the initial idea of having certain notifications appear
                                automatically for the first 2 times after updating the app.</li>
                              <li>The basic version was expanded to include more detailed function descriptions for
                                those who need them ("Learn more" button on the screen)</li>
                               <li>We have rewritten all notifications, shortening them to the maximum and changing
                                the vocabulary.</li>
                                <li>We have kept this option available and adjusted the time and distance ranges (a
                                  topic for another iteration - what works best for the user)</li>
                             </ul>
