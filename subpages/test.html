              <h3 class="mb-4">Project Description</h3>
              <p>The main goal of Ticketly is to connect all possible ways of Polish
                public transport and enable users to purchase tickets for them. It is
                a magnificent app that has been developed over the years. A
                complex infrastructure has been created connecting the app,
                website, ticket machines, bus checkouts and more.</p>
              <strong><b>Problem</b></strong>
              <p>Poor user ratings and feedback, not following the competitor's
                grown, old-fashioned look, weak system performance.</p>
              <strong><b>Solution</b></strong>
              <p>Adding the new functionalities based on the market, improving the
                registration process, changing the IA, refreshing the UI design</p>

              <br><br>

              <h3 class="mb-4">Process</h3>
              <p>Firstly, we needed to understand how the current system is working. We were surprised by
                how complicated the structure of tickets can be. We spend weeks getting to know how it
                works and what technological constraints we can meet. It helped us realize that the current
                system allows creating items without any limits. Our first thought was that we had to build
                the most flexible application possible.</p>

              <p><img src="../content/ticketly/image_1.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>

              <h3 class="mb-4">Define</h3>
              <p>We were trying to learn the most common issues users face when using the application.
                We decided to gather users feedback from the app stores reviews and the interviews.

                Furthermore, we can identify the main users' problems by considering their feedback.</p>

              <p><img src="../content/ticketly/image_2.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>



              <h3 class="mb-4">Insights</h3>
              <p>Certain user behaviors are not observable during interviews, it is why we decided to check rough data
                collected over the years. According to them, we have been able to learn more about our users.
                Understanding the typical purchase decisions made by users would help us develop a more effective
                information architecture. Some of the most significant insights we can include are:</p>
              <p><img src="../content/ticketly/image_3.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>

              <h3 class="mb-4">Gathering ideas</h3>
              <p>On the market, there are several similar solutions, but Ticketly has not been updated for
                years and lacks key functionalities. Analysis of competitors' solutions has provided us with
                ideas on which patterns we should use in our final product. In addition, by considering
                competitors' reviews from the Apple Store and Google Play, we were able to identify areas
                for improvement.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Allow users to obtain tickets without
                  registration -
                  It was not possible because of the inclusion of
                  season tickets and the requirements of certain
                  operators. We have decided to offer two
                  application options: Full and Mini.</li>
                <li>Add the current location of vehicles -
                  Nothing is worse than waiting for our train or
                  bus. Using a public API, we can track the real-
                  time location of vehicles on a map.</li>
                <li>Simplify descriptions and names -
                  Every discount name (eg. 37% - Cywilna
                  niewidoma ofiara działań wojennych
                  (całkowicie niezdolna do pracy) is a result of
                  Polish law, and we cannot modify it. We
                  decided to set new short names that users can
                  see, but we will hide the full description under
                  a button.</li>
                <li>Speed up the purchasing process -
                  Our goal was to modify the system to reduce
                  the number of steps required.</li>
                <li>Get more payment options -
                  Except for credit cards and tPurse (an internal
                  prepaid payment method), we wanted to launch
                  Apple Pay and Google Pay</li>
                <li>Improve messages content from application -
                  We have identified the most common technical
                  issues with the purchase process. Our
                  developers made the necessary optimizations.
                  Moreover, we have modified and added
                  clearer messages.</li>
              </ul>

            

              <h3 class="mb-4">Design</h3>
              <strong><b>Welcome users</b></strong>
              <p>As mentioned before, one of our goals was to
                reduce the number of steps for registration.
                Solutions that have been implemented
              <ul>
                <li>Possibility to use multiple registration methods,
                  such as using a Google, Facebook, or Apple
                  account</li>
                <li>A choice between the Basic and Full app
                  version</li>
                <li>Users are asked only for the necessary personal
                  data (full name, email address, birthdate, and
                  password) required for the monthly ticket (Full
                  version)</li>
                <li>Short descriptions in bullet points to better
                  understand the difference</li>
                <li>A progress bar at the bottom enhances the
                  visibility of the registration process.</li>

              </ul>
              </p>

              <p><img src="../content/ticketly/image_4.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>
              <h4 class="mb-4">How can I get to...</h4>
              <p>Across interviews with users and reviews left on the
                app stores, we found that people wanted more
                efficient navigation in the app. Due to the
                implementation of the OpenStreetMap API, we were
                able to introduce planner functionality.</p>
              <p>The client had one of the biggest requirements: to
                enhance people's mobility, even in small villages, by
                using multiple providers. Thanks to the API and our
                internal database, which includes the timetables of all
                small private bus providers, we were able to provide
                even more information than any similar application
                does.</p>
              <p>What is more, due to our close collaboration with
                transport providers, we can display the current
                position of vehicles in real time. Users are able to track
                the current position of a specific mean of transport.</p>

              <p><img src="../content/ticketly/image_5.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>
              
              <strong><b>Profiles as a solution for discounts mess</b></strong>
   
              <p>In some cases, users are forced to choose between as
                many as 25 different discounts. It has to be selected
                every time the user wants to buy a ticket. Every day,
                the same process. When the family is also part of the
                trip, the process becomes even more difficult. That
                made us think about how to make it easier.</p>
              <p>Polish law has dozens of discounts, and we cannot
                reduce them. However, we can tell users to select only
                once and then reuse the declared discounts every
                time.</p>
              <p>Moreover, as our research shows, 65% of our users
                prefer the "normal" ticket type (without any discount).
                It is the reason why we decided to set it as the default
                in every case when the discount profile is empty.</p>

              <p><img src="../content/ticketly/image_6.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>

        
              <strong><b>Buy a ticket quicker</b></strong>
              <p>The main problems with the ticket-buying process
                were complexity, time, and a lack of understanding of
                the offers. Unfortunately, we do not have control over
                the offers and discount content. However, we were
                able to make it more readable by using our own short
                names and putting all the long ones in the description.</p>
              <p>Following the necessary steps that must be taken
                when buying a ticket, we could skip a few or combine
                them. In fact, that makes the process at least 25%
                quicker (depending on the offer, provider, and ticket
                type).</p>
              <p>The final change was to merge all the tPurses (internal
                prepaid payment method) into one and add more
                payment methods like Apple Pay, Google Pay and Blik.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-4">Summary</h3>

              <p>To finish the first phase of the implementation of a new Ticketly release, we decided to run the
                usability
                testing with the selected test group, which was already involved in the interview session. Users
                positively reacted to most of the changes. After the testing, we decided to improve some of the
                application parts.</p>
              <p><img src="../content/ticketly/image_8.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>
              <p>After implementing the first version, we were able to measure the success of the project by the
                following factors:</p>
