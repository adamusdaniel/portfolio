              <h3 class="mb-4">Project Description</h3>
              <p>The main goal of Ticketly is to connect all possible ways of Polish
                public transport and enable users to purchase tickets for them. It is
                a magnificent app that has been developed over the years. A
                complex infrastructure has been created connecting the app,
                website, ticket machines, bus checkouts and more.</p>
                <strong><b>Problem</b></strong>
              <p>Poor user ratings and feedback, not following the competitor's
                grown, old-fashioned look, weak system performance.</p>
              <strong><b>Solution</b></strong>
              <p>Adding the new functionalities based on the market, improving the
                registration process, changing the IA, refreshing the UI design</p>
             
<br><br>

                <h3 class="mb-4">Process</h3>
                <p>Firstly, we needed to understand how the current system is working. We were surprised by
                  how complicated the structure of tickets can be. We spend weeks getting to know how it
                  works and what technological constraints we can meet. It helped us realize that the current
                  system allows creating items without any limits. Our first thought was that we had to build
                  the most flexible application possible.</p>

                <p><img src="content/niewidomi/percentage.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>
             
                <h3 class="mb-4">Define</h3>
                <p>We were trying to learn the most common issues users face when using the application.
                  We decided to gather users feedback from the app stores reviews and the interviews.
                  
                  Furthermore, we can identify the main users' problems by considering their feedback.</p>
          
                  <p><img src="content/niewidomi/percentage.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>
             
              
               
                <h3 class="mb-4">Insights</h3>       
               <p>Certain user behaviors are not observable during interviews, it is why we decided to check rough data
                collected over the years. According to them, we have been able to learn more about our users.
                Understanding the typical purchase decisions made by users would help us develop a more effective
                information architecture. Some of the most significant insights we can include are:</p>
                 <p><img src="content/niewidomi/image_2.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>    

                      <h3 class="mb-4">Gathering ideas</h3>
                      <p>On the market, there are several similar solutions, but Ticketly has not been updated for
                        years and lacks key functionalities. Analysis of competitors' solutions has provided us with
                        ideas on which patterns we should use in our final product. In addition, by considering
                        competitors' reviews from the Apple Store and Google Play, we were able to identify areas
                        for improvement.</p>

                        <ul>
                          <li>Allow users to obtain tickets without
                            registration - 
                            It was not possible because of the inclusion of
                            season tickets and the requirements of certain
                            operators. We have decided to offer two
                            application options: Full and Mini.</li>
                            <li>Add the current location of vehicles - 
                              Nothing is worse than waiting for our train or
                              bus. Using a public API, we can track the real-
                              time location of vehicles on a map.</li>
                              <li>Simplify descriptions and names - 
                                Every discount name (eg. 37% - Cywilna
                                niewidoma ofiara działań wojennych
                                (całkowicie niezdolna do pracy) is a result of
                                Polish law, and we cannot modify it. We
                                decided to set new short names that users can
                                see, but we will hide the full description under
                                a button.</li>
                                <li>Speed up the purchasing process - 
                                  Our goal was to modify the system to reduce
                                  the number of steps required.</li>
                                  <li>Get more payment options - 
                                    Except for credit cards and tPurse (an internal
                                    prepaid payment method), we wanted to launch
                                    Apple Pay and Google Pay</li>
                                    <li>Improve messages content from application - 
                                      We have identified the most common technical
                                      issues with the purchase process. Our
                                      developers made the necessary optimizations.
                                      Moreover, we have modified and added
                                      clearer messages.</li>
                        </ul>

              <h3 class="mb-4">Design</h3>       
                            
                      <p>Welcome users</p>
                        <p>As mentioned before, one of our goals was to
                          reduce the number of steps for registration.
                          Solutions that have been implemented
                          <ul>
                            <li>Possibility to use multiple registration methods,
                          such as using a Google, Facebook, or Apple
                          account</li>
                          <li>A choice between the Basic and Full app
                          version</li>
                          <li>Users are asked only for the necessary personal
                          data (full name, email address, birthdate, and
                          password) required for the monthly ticket (Full
                          version)</li>
                          <li>Short descriptions in bullet points to better
                          understand the difference</li>
                          <li>A progress bar at the bottom enhances the
                          visibility of the registration process.</li>

                          </ul>
                        </p>
              
                        <p><img src="content/niewidomi/image_4.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>

              <h3 class="mb-4">Usability Testing</h3>       
                            
                      <p>Conducting reliable research was very difficult due to the lack of
                        prototype support for screen readers.</p>
                        <p>We created a prototype in Adobe XD - the app allows users to play
                          prerecorded audio. In order to conduct research, we recorded voice
                          notifications using a speech synthesiser and created a dashboard to
                          manage them. The blind person was using the standard Moovit app
                          during the tests and we played the notifications at specific moments.</p>
                      <p><img src="content/niewidomi/image_5.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></p>        
                      <p>The location for research was always a pavement or a bus stop. We
                        had a Bluetooth speaker that our respondents could hang around
                        their necks or hold close to their ears</p>
                        <p>We have even created elements of Service Design! Not only that, but
                          we crafted a prototype of Safe Zone using cardboard and bottle caps.
                          The prototype was designed to be tactile, allowing it to be sensed
                          using a white stick and feet. We constructed a bus out of a cardboard
                          box to simulate its arrival at the bus stop.</p>

                          <h3 class="mb-4">Summary</h3>       
                            
                          <p>Usability testing with a visually imparted view provides us even more insight of the product we have made.
                            All the tested users were extremely impressed, especially in fact of the lack of implementation. However, we
                            have identified opportunities to improve the application following the gathered feedback.</p>   

                            <ul>
                              <li>We decided not to implement the initial idea of having certain notifications appear
                                automatically for the first 2 times after updating the app.</li>
                              <li>The basic version was expanded to include more detailed function descriptions for
                                those who need them ("Learn more" button on the screen)</li>
                               <li>We have rewritten all notifications, shortening them to the maximum and changing
                                the vocabulary.</li>
                                <li>We have kept this option available and adjusted the time and distance ranges (a
                                  topic for another iteration - what works best for the user)</li>
                             </ul>
